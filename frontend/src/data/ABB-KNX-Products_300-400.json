The ABB Automation Builder is integrated with the ETS through an ETS app.Up to 1000 KNX group objects can be used in the automation program. The KNX relevant settings such as physical address, linking of the controller group objects with group addresses and the KNX sending conditions are set in the ETS and can also be changed at any time without ABB Automation Builder.The building automation controller has two Ethernet network interfaces. The use is flexible adjustable. In addition to KNXnet/IP communication, these can also be used for other protocols and functions. Among other things, for Modbus TCP and a web server with a freely customizable web interface for display and operation of the system.The controller has a built-in display, an RS-232/485 interface for i. a. Modbus. The internal clock and data variables can be buffered by a battery. The internal memory of 8 MB can be extended by the memory card slot.",

Via an analog output (0…10V) the set point or set point adjustment temperature can be transmitted to the heat generator/chiller. The set point itself is received via KNX. Via two binary inputs the device can monitor the status of the heat generator/chiller (via potential free contacts) and send it on the KNX bus. A relay output (5A) is included to switch or enable/disable the heat generator/chiller. With an additional relay output (5A) the pump of the heat generator/chiller can be switched on and off. Via 3 binary inputs it is possible to monitor the status of the pump (via potential free contacts) and integrate these feedback into the control of the pump.The device supports the ABB i-bus Tool for advanced diagnosis and improved commissioning.",

Control and status feedback is carried out via KNX per DALI slave (2 x 64), with lighting groups (2 x 16), together in broadcast or per scenes (2 x 16). DALI devices type DT1 (Self-contained emergency converter acc. EN 62386-202) and type DT8 (colour temperature Tc / tunable white acc. EN 62386-209) will be supported. Extensive fault and error messages are available. By means of KNX and DT1 converter different emergencytests (e.g. function and duration test) can be triggered, test results are transferred back to KNX. With DT8 devices Dim2Warm, HCL, set and dim colour temperature are possible. Slave-, staircase-, force-, block- and scene- function are integrated. Feedback is sent. DALI telegram rate can change.For diagnostic use and individual change of the DALI address or group assignment a separate Software-Tool is available.",

    "catalogDescription": "FCC/S1.1.2.1 Fan Coil Controller, 2 x PWM, Manual Operation, 3-stage, MDRC",
    "longDescription": "For the control of fan coil units. Via two electronic outputs, two thermoelectric or one motor-driven valve drive can be controlled for heating and cooling. For the fan control the devices features three relay outputs. A relay output switches an additional load of up to 16 A, such as auxiliary heating. Over 4 inputs the room status can be detected and monitored (Use for window contact, dew point sensor, level sensor or temperature sensor). Also it is possible to connect one analog room control unit (SAR/A or SAF/A) to the inputs of the device. The device has an integrated room temperature controller for the control of the room temperature, which can be used directly to control the outputs of the device. The FCC/S 1.1.2.1 features an easy to use manual operation.The device supports the ABB i-bus Tool for advanced diagnosis and improved commissioning.",
